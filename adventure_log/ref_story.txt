2.  $ `yum install python`
    # turns out python is already installed, the command should be python3
        = generalize python command

3.  $ add code to check `python` and `python3` command
        o `run.sh`
        > `../resavant-testrunner/scripts/get_methods_coverage.py: Permission denied`
            = we don't know why??
            + this error happen to all python script call
        > `defects4j: command not found`
            = set up defects4j
        > error saying target directory doesn't exist
            = add checking

+ bout the python permission denied error
    + human error, we incorrectly assign variable in sh scripting
    + you assign by `PY_COMMAND=python` not `$PY_COMMAND=python`     
    + so, not error anymore

4.  $ installing defects4j
        + error `jar:command not found` that we have encountered before!


5.  $ installing 2 java
        + taking notes that defects4j needs java7, while daikon needs java8
