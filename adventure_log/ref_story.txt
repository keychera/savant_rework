1   $ .
    # bare centos
        o `run.sh`
        > a lot of `python: command not found`
            = set up python

2.  $ `yum install python`
    # turns out python is already installed, the command should be python3
        = generalize python command

3.  $ add code to check `python` and `python3` command
        o `run.sh`
        > `../resavant-testrunner/scripts/get_methods_coverage.py: Permission denied`
            = we don't know why??
            + this error happen to all python script call
        > `defects4j: command not found`
            = set up defects4j
        > error saying target directory doesn't exist
            = add checking

+ bout the python permission denied error
    + human error, we incorrectly assign variable in sh scripting
    + you assign by `PY_COMMAND=python` not `$PY_COMMAND=python`     
    + so, not error anymore

4.  $ installing defects4j
        + error `jar:command not found` that we have encountered before!


5.  $ installing 2 java
        + taking notes that defects4j needs java7, while daikon needs java8
        + centos8 actually doesn't support java7
        + java 7 is installed from rpm downloaded from Oracle
        + java 8 is from `yum install`
            = use `alternatives` for changing version

6.  $ defects4j `init.sh`
    # java ready, defects4j ready

7.  o `defects4j info -p Lang`
        > same bug as `https://github.com/rjust/defects4j/issues/190` appears
            = reinstall defects4j

8.  o `defects4j info -p Lang`
        > same bug as `https://github.com/rjust/defects4j/issues/125` appears
            = install needed modules by cpan

    + defects4j is working properly

9   o resavant's `./run.sh`
        > perl error `D4J_HOME not set!`
            = export the `D4J_HOME` as well in `.bash_rc file`
            = `D4J_HOME` is set to root defects4j, but you initially set it to /framework/bin, so that was where you were wrong

10  o resavant's `./run.sh`
        > python error `no module name bs4` for BeautifulSoup
            = install needed module
            = since we also use conda modules, install miniconda and all needed package
            + in our centos8, the pip command is `pip3`

    + run.sh is working properly (and fast! :o)
